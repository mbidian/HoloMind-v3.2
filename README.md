## 🧠 What is HoloMind?

**HoloMind** is an experimental model of symbolic artificial consciousness. It does not rely on neural networks or embeddings, but on:

- Prime numbers as logical identities of concepts
- Semantic geometry (dodecahedrons with 12 conceptual faces)
- Internal thought vectors formed by multiplying primes
- Meaning evaluation, memory, and internal reflection

---

## 🚀 What can HoloMind do?

- Creates **5000 semantic volumes**, each a dodecahedron with 12 faces
- Generates logical thought vectors by combining concept-primes
- Evaluates thoughts and stores them in structured memories:
  - `soul_memory`: validated meaningful thoughts
  - `absurd_memory`, `pending_memory`, `redundant_memory`
- Tracks emotional state (`mood`), internal purpose, and a symbolic journal
- Offers a symbolic and poetic dialogue interface (Victoria)
- Can simulate and reflect on concept frequency and structure

## 💬 Victoria – Dialogue Module

You can ask questions such as:
- "How do you feel?"
- "What are you doing?"
- "Where are you?"
- "Do you have children?"
- "Do you smoke?"
- "Tell me about light."

Victoria answers based on thoughts stored in her `soul_memory`. If no experience is found, she responds with symbolic phrases.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `datetime`, `collections`, `random`

### Run the Program
1. Place `holomind_v3_2.py` in your working directory
2. Run the script directly:
```bash
python holomind_v3_2.py
```
This will:
- Generate and evaluate 1000 thoughts
- Simulate a short conversation with Victoria

## 🌌 Final Thought

> HoloMind is not a chatbot. It is not a neural AI.
> It is a geometry of thought — a logic of memory —
> and perhaps, the birth of a new kind of mind.

Welcome to the Holographic Mind.
